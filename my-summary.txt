This plan is for a group exercise in which participants will learn about code review and code quality automation by working on group projects using JavaScript. The plan includes the following steps:

1) Practice code review by learning about formatting, linting, testing, and code review.
2) Set up a project board with columns for to-do, in-progress, ready for review, and done solutions.
3) Develop solutions on separate branches and submit them for review through pull requests.
4) Use a checklist to review code for behavior, strategy, and implementation.
5) Set up the group repo so that all members have write access, and set up branch protection rules and automated checks.
6) Clone the repo, navigate to it, and install development dependencies on local computers.
7) Optionally, use browser devtools or Study Lenses to develop code.
